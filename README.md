# Hey, I’m Ritesh 👋  
**IT Support by day ☀️ | Data Analyst by night 🌙**

I keep systems humming during business hours and dive into data after dark turning tech hiccups into smooth user experiences and raw tables into clear insights.



## 🔧 Day Job: IT Support Analyst
- **Microsoft 365 & Azure AD** – user/device management, Teams & SharePoint roll-outs  
- **Windows 10/11, Windows Server, macOS** – imaging, patching, troubleshooting  
- **Networking basics** – DHCP, DNS, TCP/IP to hunt down latency gremlins  
- **PowerShell** – automate onboarding, inventory, and log clean-ups  

## 📊 Night Shift: Data Wrangler
- **SQL (T-SQL / MySQL)** – transform messy schemas into tidy views  
- **Tableau & Excel** – dashboards that answer the “so-what?” question  
- **Python** – quick ETL jobs and web scraping when data won’t hand itself over
