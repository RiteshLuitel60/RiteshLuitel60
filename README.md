# Hey, I'm Ritesh ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a data analyst who enjoys figuring things out. Whether it's messy spreadsheets, inconsistent SQL tables, or raw CSVs from the web ,I like cleaning things up and turning them into something that makes sense.

ðŸ“Š I work mostly with **SQL**, **Tableau**, **Excel**, and a bit of **Python**.  
ðŸ“¦ Iâ€™ve built dashboards, cleaned datasets, automated reports, and even scraped websites for data when needed.  
ðŸ’¡ I care more about **clear insights** than flashy charts, I want to know what the dataâ€™s actually trying to say.

Iâ€™m not a rockstar. Not a ninja. Just someone who enjoys working with data and keeps showing up to learn more.

Youâ€™ll find a mix of projects here, from Excel dashboards to SQL exercises to full data workflows. Feel free to explore.
