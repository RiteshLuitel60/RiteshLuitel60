# Hey, I’m Ritesh 👋  
**IT Support by day ☀️ | Data Analyst by night 🌙**

I keep systems humming during business hours and dive into data after dark—turning tech hiccups into smooth user experiences and raw tables into clear insights.

---

## 🔧 Day Job: IT Support Analyst
- **Microsoft 365 & Azure AD** – user/device management, Teams & SharePoint roll-outs  
- **Windows 10/11, Windows Server, macOS** – imaging, patching, troubleshooting  
- **Networking basics** – DHCP, DNS, TCP/IP to hunt down latency gremlins  
- **PowerShell** – automate onboarding, inventory, and log clean-ups  

## 📊 Night Shift: Data Wrangler
- **SQL (T-SQL / MySQL)** – transform messy schemas into tidy views  
- **Tableau & Excel** – dashboards that answer the “so-what?” question  
- **Python** – quick ETL jobs and web scraping when data won’t hand itself over  

---

## 💡 How I Work
- **First-contact fixes** and **plain-English explanations** (no jargon storms)  
- Ticket notes and data docs that future-me—and teammates—can actually follow  
- Prefer **root-cause solutions** and **actionable insights** over flashy band-aids

## 🌱 Always Learning
Exploring Intune, deeper Azure automation, and next-level analytics so I can spend less time on repetitive tasks and more on interesting problems.
